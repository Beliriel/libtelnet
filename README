I. INTRODUCTION
=====================================================================

libtelnet provides safe and correct handling of the core TELNET
protocol.  It does not include any "smarts," and all use of the
protocol (such as deciding which options to support, enabling
and disabling options, or processing subrequests) must be implemented
by the application author.

II. LIBTELNET API
=====================================================================

FIXME: fill in notes about user-facing API

III. INTEGRATING LIBTELNET
=====================================================================

FIXME: fill in notes about implementing the libtelnet_*_cb functions

IV. OUTPUT PROCESSING
=====================================================================

FIXME: fill in notes about output buffering recommendations

V. SAFETY AND CORRECTNESS CONSIDERATIONS
=====================================================================

FIXME: fill in notes about recommending the user of libtelnet over
all output functions for ensuring safety
